myv6

myv6 is a re-implementation of xv6, which is a re-implementation of UNIX v6.
we add process group and CPU allocation future in this tiny os, see user_space/ulib/sys_call.h to learn more. kernel code about these future are kernel/process/proc_group.c, kernel/process/cpu_message.c and kernel/scheduler/scheduler.c.



<Run this os>:
    Run *make qemu* or *make q* under root directory of this project.
    Run *make qemu cpus=N* to run in N cpus.
    Run *make kernel_and_user* to compile the kernel, user space code and create fs.img.
    Run *make all_asm* to dump all asm files from kernel's object files.

    Run *make clean* to delte the generated files.
    Make sure that you run *make clean* after you do any change to user_space. It will clean up fs.img, and when you run kernel it will create a new fs.img from user_space.
    If you corrupt the filesystem, or you wan to run myv6 in a initial filesystem, run *make clean* to clean old filesystem and run *make q* to run os. 

<Run this os in debug mode>:
    Run *make qemu-gdb* or *make db* in a terminal, then run *gdb-multiarch* in another terminal to attach the kernel and debug.

<Test>
    Run *make qemu*, then run *ut* in the shell to check if the kernel is working.

<Tool-chain>:
To run this os, you will need:
    make
    qemu-system-riscv64
    riscv64-linux-gnu-gcc
    riscv64-linux-gnu-as
    riscv64-linux-gnu-ld
To debug this os, you will need:
    gdb-multiarch

<By the way>:
    Makefile is a ugly, hard to read, write, and anti-human design. So don't complain about my Makefile. I am too lazy to redesigning it.
    By the way, if you have question about myv6, xv6 or other kernel like these kernel, you can try to ask me and I will reply if there is time.
